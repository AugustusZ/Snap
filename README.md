## Notes
1. Work with [Snoop Catcher](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/snoop-catcher/id987378024?mt=12) (by MacDaddy), which captures images when Mac lid is opened.
2. Detect faces with **Haar Feature-based Cascade Classifiers** in OpenCV with following parameters (which have been tested for performance):
	-  `scaleFactor`: 1.025
	-  `minNeighbors`: 3
	-  `minSize`: 30 x 30

## Acknowledgement 
A million thanks to **Tongjia Shi** for his building the ground code
